                            <p class="project-desc">Structural Integrity is an advanced Virtual Reality education tool developed using C# and Unity, tailored for in-class learning with civil engineering students at Western University. This immersive simulator provides a hands-on experience, enabling students to navigate through virtual environments that mimic real-world structures. By interacting with these environments, students learn to identify various types of structural damage, assess their severity, and understand the implications for overall structural integrity. This tool not only enhances theoretical knowledge but also bridges the gap between classroom learning and practical application, preparing students for real-life engineering challenges. Through this engaging and interactive platform, students gain critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for their future careers in civil engineering.</p>

                            <p class="project-desc">This project aimed to develop and compare machine learning-based models for predicting brain age from MRI data, an important task as discrepancies between physical age and brain age can signal neurological conditions or cognitive decline, making accurate prediction models clinically significant. The study conducted a comprehensive comparison of four distinct ML models: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Residual Networks (ResNet), and Lasso regression. By evaluating these models, the project sought to identify the most effective approach for precise brain age prediction, thereby contributing valuable insights to the field of medical imaging and neurological diagnostics.</p>
